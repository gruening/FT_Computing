/** 
 * Arduino Interface to work with the fischertechnik Computing kits
 * from the 80ties.
 *
 * This base Comptuting kit allow to contruct model of simple
 * industrial robots and other devices controlled by computers. See
 * the examples that come with this class for how to use it for
 * diverse suggested models of the Computing kit.
 *
 * The Computing kit contains as sensors:
 * - 8 microswitch push buttons as digital inputs,
 * - 2 potentiometers as analog inputs 
 * and as actuator:
 * - 3 fischertechnik lamps
 * - 2 fishertechnik mini motors
 * - 1 electro magnet
 *
 * In the eighties fishertechnik provided hardware interfaces to
 * connect these components with then popular microcomputers, such as
 * diverse home computers from Commodore, Atari, Schneider etc, and
 * even the NDR-Klein-Computer (the German equivalent of the BBC
 * computer in Britain.)
 * 
 * Those interface could control up to 8 digital input lines (E1 to
 * E8), and 2  * analogue ones (EX and EY), and it could drive up to 4
 * digital outputs (M1 to M4) for the motors, magnets etc. 
 *
 * The computers for which interfaces existed are all long gone (are
 * they? I still have them in my basement), but today the Arduino is
 * alive. Hence we use it to drive the fischertechnik Computing kit.
 *
 * We connect the Arduino with the Arduino motor shield <URL> which
 * provides 2 motor outputs with enough power to drive the old
 * fischertechnic minimotors. 2 motor outputs are enough for the base
 * fischertechnik Computing kits. (More advanced kits would use up to
 * 4 motors). 
 *   
 * If you want to use also the electro magnet from the
 * kits, you will need to have a circuit that provides sufficient
 * current to the magnet as the Arduino pins themselves can only provide
 * up to 20mA (see <URL>). Such a circuit can be easily build with a
 * single power transisotor and a diode, and the schematics are
 * provided with this package at <URL>.
 *
 * All these power outputs for motors and magenets etc are capable of
 * PWM. PWM can be used in two ways for us in the ft context:
 * - ft kits were at those designed for a nominal voltage of 6V (if I
 *   am correct -- I could not find any documentation for that any
 *   longer). So if you use a power supply that provides more than 6V
 *   (the one I use provides eg 12 V), you need to make sure that the
 *   motors do not get the full 12 V, see <PWM> -- and this can be
 *   achieved by running them with a duty cycle less than
 * 255. < @todo attached my calculatrion here>
 * - in principle you can also reduce the speed with pwm, but the ft
 *   minimotor were not designed with pwm in mind -- so 1. they do get
 *   quite (insanely?) hot when driven by pwm, and 2. they do not run
 *   well with low duty cycles -- hence your choices of speed via pwm
 *   are pretty limited.
 * 
 * I suggest to connect the motor not per the old ribbon cabel
 * As opposed to the orignal use of the push buttons in the
 * fischertechnik Instruction (and actually also the standard Arduino
 * style (see <URL>), we use them here a active low
 * style. While this is wrapped and hidden from the user of this
 * interface (ie a pressed button eg e8 will lead to e8.inActive()
 * return true) you have to remember this when wiring the
 * fischertechnik buttons:
 * They need to be connect with one pole to the corresponding Arduino
 * input pin, but they need to be connect to GND -- and *NOT* to 5V as
 * in the ft instructions.
 * This change was done to be able to connect with as few external
 * components as possible.
 *
 * A second change concerns the analog inputs, ie the potentiometers:
 * I recommend connecting them directly to the analog inputs pins
 * provide by the Motor shield (ie their two outer are connected to
 * GND and 5V, while the middle pin is connect to an Arduino analog
 * input pin, see attached schematics at <URL>.
 * Also this change is due to avoiding aditional components beyond
 * what the Arduino and its motor shield provide anyway.
